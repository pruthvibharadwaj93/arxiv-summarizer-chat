        "abstracts": "Integrating multiple (sub-)systems is essential to create advanced Information Systems (ISs). Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic environments across the IS lifecycle. A traditional approach is a registry that provides the API documentation of the systems' endpoints. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be capable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service composition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input token limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions. Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. Within this work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of OpenAPIs to reduce the input token length while preserving the most relevant information. To further reduce the input token length for the composition prompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that only receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints and retrieves details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using the RestBench benchmark, first, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the endpoint retrieval recall, precision, and F1 score. Then, we assess the Discovery Agent using the same test set. With our prototype, we demonstrate how to successfully employ RAG for endpoint discovery to reduce the token count. While revealing high values for recall, precision, and F1, further research is necessary to retrieve all requisite endpoints. Our experiments show that for preprocessing, LLM-based and format-specific approaches outperform na\\\"ive chunking methods. Relying on an agent further enhances these results as the agent splits the tasks into multiple fine granular subtasks, improving the overall RAG performance in the token count, precision, and F1 score."

Studying of such symmetries will allow us to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex systems.

To this end, we introduce \\emph{CantorNet}, inspired by the triadic construction of the Cantor set, which was introduced by Georg Cantor in the $19^\\text{th}$ century. In mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line that is self-similar and has a counter intuitive property of being an uncountably infinite null set. Similarly, we introduce CantorNet as a sandbox for studying self-similarity by means of novel topological and geometrical complexity measures. CantorNet constitutes a family of ReLU neural networks that spans the whole spectrum of possible Kolmogorov complexities, including the two opposite descriptions (linear and exponential as measured by the description length). CantorNet's decision boundaries can be arbitrarily ragged, yet are analytically known. Besides serving as a testing ground for complexity measures, our work may serve to illustrate potential pitfalls in geometry-ignorant data augmentation techniques and adversarial"

While many tools exist empowering developers to build their own systems, measuring their performance locally, with datasets reflective of the system's use cases, is a technological challenge. Solutions to this problem range from non-specific and cheap (most public datasets) to specific and costly (generating data from local documents). In this paper, we show that using public question and answer (Q&A) datasets to assess retrieval performance can lead to non-optimal systems design, and that common tools for RAG dataset generation can lead to unbalanced data. We propose solutions to these issues based on the characterization of RAG datasets through labels and through label-targeted data generation. Finally, we show that fine-tuned small LLMs can efficiently generate Q&A datasets. We believe that these observations are invaluable to the know-your-data step of RAG systems"

This pilot study focuses on specializing ChatGPT behavior through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the OpenAI custom GPTs feature. The purpose of our chatbot, called Unimib Assistant, is to provide information and solutions to the specific needs of University of Milano-Bicocca (Unimib) students through a question-answering approach. We provided the system with a prompt highlighting its specific purpose and behavior, as well as university-related documents and links obtained from an initial need-finding phase, interviewing six students. After a preliminary customization phase, a qualitative usability test was conducted with six other students to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the chatbot, with the goal of improving it in a subsequent redesign phase. While the chatbot was appreciated for its user-friendly experience, perceived general reliability, well-structured responses, and conversational tone, several significant technical and functional limitations emerged. In particular, the satisfaction and overall experience of the users was impaired by the system's inability to always provide fully accurate information. Moreover, it would often neglect to report relevant information even if present in the materials uploaded and prompt given. Furthermore, it sometimes generated unclickable links, undermining its trustworthiness, since providing the source of information was an important aspect for our users. Further in-depth studies and feedback from other users as well as implementation iterations are planned to refine our Unimib Assistant."

In the automotive industry, there is a growing demand for knowledge transfer of failure analysis from experienced engineers to young engineers. However, failure events are phenomena that occur in a chain reaction, making them difficult for beginners to analyze them. While knowledge graphs, which can describe semantic relationships and structure information is effective in representing failure events, due to their capability of representing the relationships between components, there is much information in KGs, so it is challenging for young engineers to extract and understand sub-graphs from the KG. On the other hand, there is increasing interest in the use of Graph RAG, a type of RAG that combines LLMs and KGs for knowledge management. However, when using the current Graph RAG framework with an existing knowledge graph for automobile failures, several issues arise because it is difficult to generate executable queries for a knowledge graph database which is not constructed by LLMs. To address this, we focused on optimizing the Graph RAG pipeline for existing knowledge graphs. Using an original Q&A dataset, the ROUGE F1 score of the sentences generated by the proposed method showed an average improvement of 157.6% compared to the current method.

Existing models have limited spatial perception and often exhibit structural hallucinations in this high-specification generative task. To address this issue, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed RAGDiffusion, to enhance structure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by assimilating external knowledge from LLM and databases. RAGDiffusion consists of two core processes: (1) Retrieval-based structure aggregation, which employs contrastive learning and a Structure Locally Linear Embedding (SLLE) to derive global structure and spatial landmarks, providing both soft and hard guidance to counteract structural ambiguities; and (2) Omni-level faithful garment generation, which introduces a three-level alignment that ensures fidelity in structural, pattern, and decoding components within the diffusing. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGDiffusion synthesizes structurally and detail-faithful clothing assets with significant performance improvements, representing a pioneering effort in high-specification faithful generation with RAG to confront intrinsic hallucinations and enhance fidelity."

While LLM-driven RAG systems show superior performance, they face unique challenges in stability and reliability. Their complexity hinders developers' efforts to design, maintain, and optimize effective RAG systems. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how RAG's performance is impacted by its design. In this work, we conduct an early exploratory study toward a better understanding of the mechanism of RAG systems, covering three code datasets, three QA datasets, and two LLMs. We focus on four design factors: retrieval document type, retrieval recall, document selection, and prompt techniques. Our study uncovers how each factor impacts system correctness and confidence, providing valuable insights for developing an accurate and reliable RAG system. Based on these findings, we present nine actionable guidelines for detecting defects and optimizing the performance of RAG systems. We hope our early exploration can inspire further advancements in engineering, improving and maintaining LLM-driven intelligent software systems for greater efficiency and reliability."

Existing work typically employs few-shot prompting or manually constructed rules to implement iterative retrieval. This introduces additional inference overhead and overlooks the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce Auto-RAG, an autonomous iterative retrieval model centered on the LLM's powerful decision-making capabilities. Auto-RAG engages in multi-turn dialogues with the retriever, systematically planning retrievals and refining queries to acquire valuable knowledge. This process continues until sufficient external information is gathered, at which point the results are presented to the user. To this end, we develop a method for autonomously synthesizing reasoning-based decision-making instructions in iterative retrieval and fine-tuned the latest open-source LLMs. The experimental results indicate that Auto-RAG is capable of autonomous iterative interaction with the retriever, effectively leveraging the remarkable reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs, which lead to outstanding performance across six benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that Auto-RAG can autonomously adjust the number of iterations based on the difficulty of the questions and the utility of the retrieved knowledge, without requiring any human intervention. Moreover, Auto-RAG expresses the iterative retrieval process in natural language, enhancing interpretability while providing users with a more intuitive experience\\footnote{Code is available at"

Employing a user-centered design approach, we developed the chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which enables behavior personalization without retraining the underlying language model (GPT-4). The system leverages document retrieval and specialized prompts to tailor interactions, drawing from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and narrative therapy techniques. A key challenge in the development process was the difficulty of translating declarative knowledge into effective interaction behaviors. In the initial phase, the chatbot was provided with declarative knowledge about CBT via reference textbooks and high-level conversational goals. However, this approach resulted in imprecise and inefficient behavior, as the GPT model struggled to convert static information into dynamic and contextually appropriate interactions. This highlighted the limitations of relying solely on declarative knowledge to guide chatbot behavior, particularly in nuanced, therapeutic conversations. Over four iterations, we addressed this issue by gradually transitioning towards procedural knowledge, refining the chatbot's interaction strategies, and improving its overall effectiveness. In the final evaluation, 5 participants engaged with the chatbot over five consecutive days, receiving individualized CBT interventions. The Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI) was used to measure habit strength before and after the intervention, revealing a reduction in habit strength post-intervention. These results underscore the importance of procedural knowledge in driving effective, personalized behavior change support in RAG-based systems."

        "abstracts": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are progressively deployed across diverse fields and real-world applications, ensuring the security and robustness of LLMs has become ever more critical. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge approach designed to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs). By retrieving information from the relevant knowledge database, RAG enriches the input to LLMs, enabling them to produce responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate. It is worth noting that the knowledge database, being sourced from publicly available channels such as Wikipedia, inevitably introduces a new attack surface. RAG poisoning involves injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database, ultimately leading to the generation of the attacker's target response (also called poisoned response). However, there are currently limited methods available for detecting such poisoning attacks. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we introduce RevPRAG, a flexible and automated detection pipeline that leverages the activations of LLMs for poisoned response detection. Our investigation uncovers distinct patterns in LLMs' activations when generating correct responses versus poisoned responses. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and RAG architectures show our approach could achieve 98% true positive rate, while maintaining false positive rates close to 1%. We also evaluate recent backdoor detection methods specifically designed for LLMs and applicable for identifying poisoned responses in RAG. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses them."

Additionally, we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning-to-Rank from AI Feedback (RLRAIF) algorithm, designed to fine-tune retrieval models using minimal feedback from the LLM. Our experimental results reveal notable differences between ICLERB and existing benchmarks, and demonstrate that small models fine-tuned with our RLRAIF algorithm outperform large state-of-the-art retrieval models. These findings highlight the limitations of existing evaluation methods and the need for specialized benchmarks and training strategies adapted to ICL."

However, LLMs struggle to generate accurate code, resulting, e.g., in attack detectors that miss well-known attacks when used in practice. This is most likely due to the LLM lacking knowledge about some existing attacks and to the generated code being not evaluated in real usage scenarios. We propose a novel approach integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Self-Ranking into the LLM pipeline. RAG enhances the robustness of the output by incorporating external knowledge sources, while the Self-Ranking technique, inspired to the concept of Self-Consistency, generates multiple reasoning paths and creates ranks to select the most robust detector. Our extensive empirical study targets code generated by LLMs to detect two prevalent injection attacks in web security: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (SQLi). Results show a significant improvement in detection performance compared to baselines, with an increase of up to 71%pt and 37%pt in the F2-Score for XSS and SQLi detection, respectively."

We challenge the assumption that these latent features ought to be high-dimensional vectors which require model fine tuning to handle. Here we propose Label Boosted Retrieval Augmented Generation (LaB-RAG), a text-based approach to image captioning that leverages image descriptors in the form of categorical labels to boost standard retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with pretrained large language models (LLMs). We study our method in the context of radiology report generation (RRG), where the task is to generate a clinician's report detailing their observations from a set of radiological images, such as X-rays. We argue that simple linear classifiers over extracted image embeddings can effectively transform X-rays into text-space as radiology-specific labels. In combination with standard RAG, we show that these derived text labels can be used with general-domain LLMs to generate radiology reports. Without ever training our generative language model or image feature encoder models, and without ever directly \"showing\" the LLM an X-ray, we demonstrate that LaB-RAG achieves better results across natural language and radiology language metrics compared with other retrieval-based RRG methods, while attaining competitive results compared to other fine-tuned vision-language RRG models. We further present results of our experiments with various components of LaB-RAG to better understand our method.

A typical solution is to employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) coupled with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which decomposes complex questions into chain-like sub-questions and applies iterative RAG at each sub-question. However, prior works exhibit sub-optimal reasoning planning and overlook dynamic knowledge retrieval from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, we propose AtomR, a novel heterogeneous knowledge reasoning framework that conducts multi-source reasoning at the atomic level. Drawing inspiration from the graph modeling of knowledge, AtomR leverages large language models (LLMs) to decompose complex questions into combinations of three atomic knowledge operators, significantly enhancing the reasoning process at both the planning and execution stages.

        "abstracts": "Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) requires time-critical management, with hours of delayed intervention leading to an irreversible disability of the patient. Since diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) using the magnetic resonance image (MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection of AIS, automated prediction of AIS from DWI has been a research topic of clinical importance. While text radiology reports contain the most relevant clinical information from the image findings, the difficulty of mapping across different modalities has limited the factuality of conventional direct DWI-to-report generation methods. Here, we propose paired image-domain retrieval and text-domain augmentation (PIRTA), a cross-modal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for providing clinician-interpretative AIS radiology reports with improved factuality. PIRTA mitigates the need for learning cross-modal mapping, which poses difficulty in image-to-text generation, by casting the cross-modal mapping problem as an in-domain retrieval of similar DWI images that have paired ground-truth text radiology reports. By exploiting the retrieved radiology reports to augment the report generation process of the query image, we show by experiments with extensive in-house and public datasets that PIRTA can accurately retrieve relevant reports from 3D DWI images. This approach enables the generation of radiology reports with significantly higher accuracy compared to direct image-to-text generation using state-of-the-art multimodal language models."

Thus, multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) is naturally introduced to provide MLLMs with comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge, effectively expanding the knowledge scope. However, current mRAG methods have inherent drawbacks, including: 1) Performing retrieval even when external knowledge is not needed. 2) Lacking of identification of evidence that supports the query. 3) Increasing model complexity due to additional information filtering modules or rules. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel generalized framework called \\textbf{m}ultimodal (mR$^2$AG), which achieves adaptive retrieval and useful information localization to enable answers through two easy-to-implement reflection operations, preventing high model complexity. In mR$^2$AG, Retrieval-Reflection is designed to distinguish different user queries and avoids redundant retrieval calls, and Relevance-Reflection is introduced to guide the MLLM in locating beneficial evidence of the retrieved content and generating answers accordingly. In addition, mR$^2$AG can be integrated into any well-trained MLLM with efficient fine-tuning on the proposed mR$^2$AG Instruction-Tuning dataset (mR$^2$AG-IT). mR$^2$AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4v/o) and RAG-based MLLMs on INFOSEEK and Encyclopedic-VQA, while maintaining the exceptional capabilities of base MLLMs across a wide range of"

We implement an agent-based parsing technique to achieve a more detailed representation of the documents. Our improved version of Graph RAG called G-RAG further leverages a graph database to capture relationships between these entities, improving both retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding.

In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework that incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively, significantly outperforming the latest LLMs (ChatGPT 4o and o1-preview), which achieved a 27.77% success rate on standard simulation tasks and 0% on complex tasks. Additionally, our framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond."

In this context, Aspect-Based Summarization (ABS) systems that extract and summarize relevant information are particularly useful as they provide stakeholders with a convenient way of finding relevant information in expert-curated reports. In this work, we release a new dataset for ABS of Climate Change reports and we employ different Large Language Models (LLMs) and so-called Small Language Models (SLMs) to tackle this problem in an unsupervised way. Considering the problem at hand, we also show how SLMs are not significantly worse for the problem while leading to reduced carbon footprint; we do so by applying for the first time an existing framework considering both energy efficiency and task performance to the evaluation of zero-shot generative models for ABS. Overall, our results show that modern language models, both big and small, can effectively tackle ABS for Climate Change reports but more research is needed when we frame the problem as a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) problem and our work and dataset will help foster efforts in this direction."

Here we present an integrated approach that combines deep learning-based vision and language models to improve ecological reporting using data from camera traps. We introduce a two-stage system: YOLOv10-X to localise and classify species (mammals and birds) within images, and a Phi-3.5-vision-instruct model to read YOLOv10-X binding box labels to identify species, overcoming its limitation with hard to classify objects in images. Additionally, Phi-3.5 detects broader variables, such as vegetation type, and time of day, providing rich ecological and environmental context to YOLO's species detection output. When combined, this output is processed by the model's natural language system to answer complex queries, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is employed to enrich responses with external information, like species weight and IUCN status (information that cannot be obtained through direct visual analysis). This information is used to automatically generate structured reports, providing biodiversity stakeholders with deeper insights into, for example, species abundance, distribution, animal behaviour, and habitat selection. Our approach delivers contextually rich narratives that aid in wildlife management decisions. By providing contextually rich insights, our approach not only reduces manual effort but also supports timely decision-making in conservation, potentially shifting efforts from reactive to proactive management."

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLM performance by integrating external knowledge bases, providing additional context which significantly improves accuracy and knowledge coverage. However, building these external knowledge bases often requires substantial resources and may involve sensitive information. In this paper, we propose an agent-based automated privacy attack called RAG-Thief, which can extract a scalable amount of private data from the private database used in RAG applications. We conduct a systematic study on the privacy risks associated with RAG applications, revealing that the vulnerability of LLMs makes the private knowledge bases suffer significant privacy risks. Unlike previous manual attacks which rely on traditional prompt injection techniques, RAG-Thief starts with an initial adversarial query and learns from model responses, progressively generating new queries to extract as many chunks from the knowledge base as possible. Experimental results show that our RAG-Thief can extract over 70% information from the private knowledge bases within customized RAG applications deployed on local machines and real-world platforms, including OpenAI's GPTs and ByteDance's Coze.

However, their effectiveness is constrained by their ability to tailor responses to human preferences and behaviors via personalization. Prior work in LLM personalization has largely focused on style transfer or incorporating small factoids about the user, as knowledge injection remains an open challenge. In this paper, we explore injecting knowledge of prior conversations into LLMs to enable future work on less redundant, personalized conversations. We identify two real-world constraints: (1) conversations are sequential in time and must be treated as such during training, and (2) per-user personalization is only viable in parameter-efficient settings. To this aim, we propose PLUM, a pipeline performing data augmentation for up-sampling conversations as question-answer pairs, that are then used to finetune a low-rank adaptation adapter with a weighted cross entropy loss. Even in this first exploration of the problem, we perform competitively with baselines such as RAG, attaining an accuracy of 81.5% across 100 conversations."

To investigate these risks, we present AIDBench, a new benchmark that incorporates several author identification datasets, including emails, blogs, reviews, articles, and research papers. AIDBench utilizes two evaluation methods: one-to-one authorship identification, which determines whether two texts are from the same author; and one-to-many authorship identification, which, given a query text and a list of candidate texts, identifies the candidate most likely written by the same author as the query text. We also introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based method to enhance the large-scale authorship identification capabilities of LLMs, particularly when input lengths exceed the models' context windows, thereby establishing a new baseline for authorship identification using LLMs. Our experiments with AIDBench demonstrate that LLMs can correctly guess authorship at rates well above random chance, revealing new privacy risks posed by these powerful models.

This paper explores the uncharted territory of potential biases in state-of-the-art universal text embedding models towards specific document and query writing styles within Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Our investigation reveals that different embedding models exhibit different preferences of document writing style, while more informal and emotive styles are less favored by most embedding models. In terms of query writing styles, many embedding models tend to match the style of the query with the style of the retrieved documents, but some show a consistent preference for specific styles. Text embedding models fine-tuned on synthetic data generated by LLMs display a consistent preference for certain style of generated data. These biases in text embedding based IR systems can inadvertently silence or marginalize certain communication styles, thereby posing a significant threat to fairness in information retrieval. Finally, we also compare the answer styles of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on different LLMs and find out that most text embedding models are biased towards LLM's answer styles when used as evaluation metrics for answer correctness. This study sheds light on the critical issue of writing style based bias in IR systems, offering valuable insights for the development of more fair and robust models."

However, interoperability challenges, particularly with missing medical codes, hinders effective data integration across studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for automated coding without labeled data, current approaches face challenges on complex coding tasks. We introduce ALIGN, a novel compositional LLM-based system for automated, zero-shot medical coding. ALIGN follows a three-step process: (1) diverse candidate code generation; (2) self-evaluation of codes and (3) confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation enabling human deferral to ensure reliability. We evaluate ALIGN on harmonizing medication terms into Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and medical history terms into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes extracted from 22 immunology trials. ALIGN outperformed the LLM baselines, while also providing capabilities for trustworthy deployment. For MedDRA coding, ALIGN achieved high accuracy across all levels, matching RAG and excelling at the most specific levels (87-90% for HLGT). For ATC coding, ALIGN demonstrated superior performance, particularly at lower hierarchy levels (ATC Level 4), with 72-73% overall accuracy and 86-89% accuracy for common medications, outperforming baselines by 7-22%. ALIGN's uncertainty-based deferral improved accuracy by 17% to 90% accuracy with 30% deferral, notably enhancing performance on uncommon medications.

Task planning under these constraints is essential for enabling autonomous robot operation in domains that require adherence to domain-specific knowledge. Current methods for generating robot goals and plans rely on common sense knowledge encoded in large language models. However, these models lack grounding of robot plans to domain-specific knowledge and are not easily transferable between multiple sites or customers with different compliance needs. In this work, we present SayComply, which enables grounding robotic task planning with operational compliance using retrieval-based language models. We design a hierarchical database of operational, environment, and robot embodiment manuals and procedures to enable efficient retrieval of the relevant context under the limited context length of the LLMs. We then design a task planner using a tree-based retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique to generate robot tasks that follow user instructions while simultaneously complying with the domain knowledge in the database. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach through simulations and hardware experiments in real-world scenarios that require precise context retrieval across various types of context, outperforming the standard RAG method.

To reduce these risks, anomaly detection methods based on physical invariants have been developed. However, these methods often require domain-specific expertise to manually define invariants, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach to extract physical invariants from CPS testbeds for anomaly detection. Our insight is that CPS design documentation often contains semantically rich descriptions of physical procedures, which can profile inter-correlated dynamics among system components. Leveraging the built-in physics and engineering knowledge of recent generative AI models, we aim to automate this traditionally manual process, improving scalability and reducing costs. This work focuses on designing and optimizing a Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) workflow with a customized prompting system tailored for CPS documentation, enabling accurate extraction of semantic information and inference of physical invariants from complex, multimodal content. Then, rather than directly applying the inferred invariants for anomaly detection, we introduce an innovative statistics-based learning approach that integrates these invariants into the training dataset. This method addresses limitations such as hallucination and concept drift, enhancing the reliability of the model. We evaluate our approach on real-world public CPS security dataset which contains 86 data points and 58 attacking cases.

        "abstracts": "This study investigates the automation of meta-analysis in scientific documents using large language models (LLMs). Meta-analysis is a robust statistical method that synthesizes the findings of multiple studies support articles to provide a comprehensive understanding. We know that a meta-article provides a structured analysis of several articles. However, conducting meta-analysis by hand is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and susceptible to human error, highlighting the need for automated pipelines to streamline the process. Our research introduces a novel approach that fine-tunes the LLM on extensive scientific datasets to address challenges in big data handling and structured data extraction. We automate and optimize the meta-analysis process by integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Tailored through prompt engineering and a new loss metric, Inverse Cosine Distance (ICD), designed for fine-tuning on large contextual datasets, LLMs efficiently generate structured meta-analysis content. Human evaluation then assesses relevance and provides information on model performance in key metrics. This research demonstrates that fine-tuned models outperform non-fine-tuned models, with fine-tuned LLMs generating 87.6% relevant meta-analysis abstracts. The relevance of the context, based on human evaluation, shows a reduction in irrelevancy from 4.56% to 1.9%. These experiments were conducted in a low-resource environment, highlighting the study's contribution to enhancing the efficiency and reliability of meta-analysis automation."

This paper presents the first hallucination survey of popular LLMs for causal discovery. We show that hallucinations exist when using LLMs in causal discovery so the choice of LLM is important. We propose using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to reduce hallucinations when quality data is available.

We have identified RAG evaluation as a barrier to continued progress in information access (and more broadly, natural language processing and artificial intelligence), and it is our hope that we can contribute to tackling the many challenges in this space. The central hypothesis we explore in this work is that the nugget evaluation methodology, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering Track in 2003, provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. As such, our efforts have focused on \"refactoring\" this methodology, specifically applying large language models to both automatically create nuggets and to automatically assign nuggets to system answers. We call this the AutoNuggetizer framework. Within the TREC setup, we are able to calibrate our fully automatic process against a manual process whereby nuggets are created by human assessors semi-manually and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on initial results across 21 topics from 45 runs, we observe a strong correlation between scores derived from a fully automatic nugget evaluation and a (mostly) manual nugget evaluation by human assessors. This suggests that our fully automatic evaluation process can be used to guide future iterations of RAG systems."

However, the methodological details of these DL models are often hidden in the unstructured text.

We built a voting classifier from the outputs of five LLMs to accurately report DL methodological information.

This paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive evaluation framework for medical question-answering (QA) systems in a RAG setting for these situations, including sufficiency, integration, and robustness. We introduce Medical Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark (MedRGB) that provides various supplementary elements to four medical QA datasets for testing LLMs' ability to handle these specific scenarios.

This paper reports on the results of a large-scale evaluation (the TREC 2024 RAG Track) where four different relevance assessment approaches were deployed in situ: the \"standard\" fully manual process that NIST has implemented for decades and three different alternatives that take advantage of LLMs to different extents using the open-source UMBRELA tool. This setup allows us to correlate system rankings induced by the different approaches to characterize tradeoffs between cost and quality. We find that in terms of nDCG@20, nDCG@100, and Recall@100, system rankings induced by automatically generated relevance assessments from UMBRELA correlate highly with those induced by fully manual assessments across a diverse set of 77 runs from 19 teams. Our results suggest that automatically generated UMBRELA judgments can replace fully manual judgments to accurately capture run-level effectiveness. Surprisingly, we find that LLM assistance does not appear to increase correlation with fully manual assessments, suggesting that costs associated with human-in-the-loop processes do not bring obvious tangible benefits. Overall, human assessors appear to be stricter than UMBRELA in applying relevance criteria.

By transforming UHR remote sensing image analysis task to image's long context selection task, we design an innovative image contextual retrieval mechanism based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, denoted as ImageRAG. ImageRAG's core innovation lies in its ability to selectively retrieve and focus on the most relevant portions of the UHR image as visual contexts that pertain to a given query.

A typical RAG implementation uses powerful retrieval models to extract external information and large language models (LLMs) to generate answers. In contrast, recent LLM-based retrieval has gained attention for its substantial improvements in information retrieval (IR) due to the LLMs' semantic understanding capability. However, directly applying LLM to RAG systems presents challenges. This may cause feature locality problems as massive parametric knowledge can hinder effective usage of global information across the corpus; for example, an LLM-based retriever often inputs document summaries instead of full documents. Moreover, various pre-trained tasks in LLMs introduce variance, further weakening performance as a retriever. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning architecture called Invar-RAG. In the retrieval stage, an LLM-based retriever is constructed by integrating LoRA-based representation learning to tackle feature locality issues. To enhance retrieval performance, we develop two patterns (invariant and variant patterns) and an invariance loss to reduce LLM variance. In the generation stage, a refined fine-tuning method is employed to improve LLM accuracy in generating answers based on retrieved information. Experimental results show that Invar-RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines across three open-domain question answering (ODQA) datasets.

To handle these limitations, we present RAG, a Regional-Aware text-to-image Generation method conditioned on regional descriptions for precise layout composition. RAG decouple the multi-region generation into two sub-tasks, the construction of individual region (Regional Hard Binding) that ensures the regional prompt is properly executed, and the overall detail refinement (Regional Soft Refinement) over regions that dismiss the visual boundaries and enhance adjacent interactions. Furthermore, RAG novelly makes repainting feasible, where users can modify specific unsatisfied regions in the last generation while keeping all other regions unchanged, without relying on additional inpainting models.

By minimizing retrieval requests that yield neutral or harmful results, we can effectively reduce both time and computational costs, while also improving the overall performance of LLMs. This insight motivates us to differentiate between types of questions using certain metrics as indicators, to decrease the retrieval ratio without compromising performance. In our work, we propose a method that is able to identify different types of questions from this view by training a Knowledge Boundary Model (KBM).

        "abstracts": "Augmenting LLMs with context leads to improved performance across many applications. Despite much research on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, an open question is whether errors arise because LLMs fail to utilize the context from retrieval or the context itself is insufficient to answer the query. To shed light on this, we develop a new notion of sufficient context, along with a way to classify instances that have enough information to answer the query. We then use sufficient context to analyze several models and datasets. By stratifying errors based on context sufficiency, we find that proprietary LLMs (Gemini, GPT, Claude) excel at answering queries when the context is sufficient, but often output incorrect answers instead of abstaining when the context is not. On the other hand, open-source LLMs (Llama, Mistral, Gemma) hallucinate or abstain often, even with sufficient context. We further categorize cases when the context is useful, and improves accuracy, even though it does not fully answer the query and the model errs without the context. Building on our findings, we explore ways to reduce hallucinations in RAG systems, including a new selective generation method that leverages sufficient context information for guided abstention. Our method improves the fraction of correct answers among times where the model responds by 2-10% for Gemini, GPT,"

And second, a Knowledge Graph (KG_RAG) based method that uses semantic tagging, and, retrieves knowledge graph triples from a graph database, as context. KG_RAG uses knowledge graphs constructed using a small model that is fine-tuned using knowledge distillation using a large teacher model. The data consists of 18 10K reports of Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, NVIDIA, Amazon and Tesla for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. The list of questions in the data consists of 111 complex questions including many esoteric questions that are difficult to answer and the answers are not completely obvious. As evaluation metrics, we use overall scores as well as segmented scores for measurement including the faithfulness, relevance, correctness, similarity, an LLM based overall score and the rouge scores as well as a similarity of embeddings. We find that both methods outperform plain RAG significantly. KG_RAG outperforms RAG_SEM in four out of nine metrics."

Existing methods focus on handling single-page documents with multi-modal language models (MLMs), or rely on text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that uses text extraction tools such as optical character recognition (OCR). However, there are difficulties in applying these methods in real-world scenarios: (a) questions often require information across different pages or documents, where MLMs cannot handle many long documents; (b) documents often have important information in visual elements such as figures, but text extraction tools ignore them. We introduce M3DocRAG, a novel multi-modal RAG framework that flexibly accommodates various document contexts (closed-domain and open-domain), question hops (single-hop and multi-hop), and evidence modalities (text, chart, figure, etc.). M3DocRAG finds relevant documents and answers questions using a multi-modal retriever and an MLM, so that it can efficiently handle single or many documents while preserving visual information. Since previous DocVQA datasets ask questions in the context of a specific document, we also present M3DocVQA, a new benchmark for evaluating open-domain DocVQA over 3,000+ PDF documents with 40,000+ pages. In three benchmarks (M3DocVQA/MMLongBench-Doc/MP-DocVQA), empirical results show that M3DocRAG with ColPali and Qwen2-VL 7B achieves superior performance than many strong baselines, including state-of-the-art performance in MP-DocVQA. We provide comprehensive analyses of different indexing, MLMs, and retrieval models.

However, traditional IETMs face challenges such as transitioning from Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to natural Language User Interfaces (LUIs) and managing complex logical relationships. Additionally, they must meet the current demands for higher intelligence. This paper proposes a Maintenance Scheme Generation Method based on Large Language Models (LLM-R).

This method prevents knowledge conflicts caused by mixed data, improving the model's adaptability and reasoning ability in specific maintenance domains, Besides, Hierarchical Task-Based Agent and Instruction-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies are adopted to optimize the generation steps and mitigate the phenomenon of hallucination caused by the model's Inability to access contextual information. This enhancement improves the model's flexibility and accuracy in handling known or unknown maintenance objects and maintenance scheme scenarios. To validate the proposed method's effectiveness in maintenance tasks, a maintenance scheme dataset was constructed using objects from different fields. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the maintenance schemes generated by the proposed method reached 91.59%, indicating which improvement enhances the intelligence of maintenance schemes and introduces novel technical approaches"

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) applications, fostering advancements in the automatic design process for large-scale AMS circuits. However, the absence of high-quality datasets has led to issues such as model hallucination, which undermines the robustness of automatically generated circuit designs. To address this issue, this paper introduces AMSnet-KG, a dataset encompassing various AMS circuit schematics and netlists. We construct a knowledge graph with annotations on detailed functional and performance characteristics. Facilitated by AMSnet-KG, we propose an automated AMS circuit generation framework that utilizes the comprehensive knowledge embedded in LLMs. We first formulate a design strategy (e.g., circuit architecture using a number of circuit components) based on required specifications. Next, matched circuit components are retrieved and assembled into a complete topology, and transistor sizing is obtained through Bayesian optimization. Simulation results of the netlist are fed back to the LLM for further topology refinement, ensuring the circuit design specifications are met. We perform case studies of operational amplifier and comparator design to verify the automatic design flow from specifications to netlists with minimal human effort.

Previous approaches typically train retrievers based on semantic similarity, lacking optimization for RAG. More recent works have proposed aligning retrievers with the preference signals of LLMs. However, these preference signals are often difficult for dense retrievers, which typically have weaker language capabilities, to understand and learn effectively. Drawing inspiration from pedagogical theories like Guided Discovery Learning, we propose a novel framework, FiGRet (Fine-grained Guidance for Retrievers), which leverages the language capabilities of LLMs to construct examples from a more granular, information-centric perspective to guide the learning of retrievers. Specifically, our method utilizes LLMs to construct easy-to-understand examples from samples where the retriever performs poorly, focusing on three learning objectives highly relevant to the RAG scenario: relevance, comprehensiveness, and purity. These examples serve as scaffolding to ultimately align the retriever with the LLM's preferences. Furthermore, we employ a dual curriculum learning strategy and leverage the reciprocal feedback between LLM and retriever to further enhance the performance of the RAG system.

Typically, such RAG systems retrieve search results, download HTML sources of the results, and then extract plain texts from the HTML sources. Plain text documents or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment the generation. However, much of the structural and semantic information inherent in HTML, such as headings and table structures, is lost during this plain-text-based RAG process. To alleviate this problem, we propose HtmlRAG, which uses HTML instead of plain text as the format of retrieved knowledge in RAG. We believe HTML is better than plain text in modeling knowledge in external documents, and most LLMs possess robust capacities to understand HTML. However, utilizing HTML presents new challenges. HTML contains additional content such as tags, JavaScript, and CSS specifications, which bring extra input tokens and noise to the RAG system. To address this issue, we propose HTML cleaning, compression, and pruning strategies, to shorten the HTML while minimizing the loss of information. Specifically, we design a two-step block-tree-based pruning method that prunes useless HTML blocks and keeps only the relevant part of the HTML. Experiments on six QA datasets confirm the superiority of using HTML in RAG systems."

        "abstracts": "The telecommunications industry's rapid evolution demands intelligent systems capable of managing complex networks and adapting to emerging technologies. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in addressing these challenges, their deployment in telecom environments faces significant constraints due to edge device limitations and inconsistent documentation. To bridge this gap, we present TeleOracle, a telecom-specialized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system built on the Phi-2 small language model (SLM). To improve context retrieval, TeleOracle employs a two-stage retriever that incorporates semantic chunking and hybrid keyword and semantic search. Additionally, we expand the context window during inference to enhance the model's performance on open-ended queries. We also employ low-rank adaption for efficient fine-tuning. A thorough analysis of the model's performance indicates that our RAG framework is effective in aligning Phi-2 to the telecom domain in a downstream question and answer (QnA) task, achieving a 30% improvement in accuracy over the base Phi-2 model, reaching an overall accuracy of 81.20%. Notably, we show that our model not only performs on par with the much larger LLMs but also achieves a higher faithfulness score, indicating higher adherence to the retrieved"

        "abstracts": "AI agents are increasingly tasked with making proactive suggestions in online spaces where groups collaborate, but can be unhelpful or even annoying, due to not fitting the group's preferences or behaving in socially inappropriate ways. Fortunately, group spaces have a rich history of prior social interactions and affordances for social feedback to support creating agents that align to a group's interests and norms. We present Social-RAG, a workflow for grounding agents to social information about a group, which retrieves from prior group interactions, selects relevant social signals, and then feeds the context into a large language model to generate messages to the group. We implement this into PaperPing, our system that posts academic paper recommendations in group chat, leveraging social signals determined from formative studies with 39 researchers. From a three-month deployment in 18 channels, we observed PaperPing posted relevant messages in groups without disrupting their existing social practices, fostering group common ground."

However, in the tourism domain, since the query is usually brief and the content in the database is diverse, existing RAG may contain a significant amount of irrelevant or contradictory information contents after retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose the QCG-Rerank model. This model first performs an initial retrieval to obtain candidate chunks and then enhances semantics by extracting critical information to expand the original query. Next, we utilize the expanded query and candidate chunks to calculate similarity scores as the initial transition probability and construct the chunks graph. Subsequently, We iteratively compute the transition probabilities based on an initial estimate until convergence. The chunks with the highest score are selected and input into the LLMs to generate responses. We evaluate the model on Cultour, IIRC, StrategyQA, HotpotQA, SQuAD, and MuSiQue datasets.

        "abstracts": "Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as few-shot learners capable of handling a variety of tasks, including comprehension, planning, reasoning, question answering, arithmetic calculations, and more. At the core of these capabilities is LLMs' proficiency in representing and understanding structural or semi-structural data, such as tables and graphs. Numerous studies have demonstrated that reasoning on tabular data or graphs is not only feasible for LLMs but also gives a promising research direction which treats these data as in-context data. The lightweight and human readable characteristics of in-context database can potentially make it an alternative for the traditional database in typical RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) settings. However, almost all current work focuses on static in-context data, which does not allow dynamic update. In this paper, to enable dynamic database update, delta encoding of database is proposed. We explore how data stored in traditional RDBMS can be encoded as in-context text and evaluate LLMs' proficiency for CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on in-context databases. A benchmark named InConDB is presented and extensive experiments are conducted to show the performance of different language models in enabling in-context database by varying the database encoding method, prompting method, operation type and input data distribution, revealing both the proficiency and"

Current RAG systems lack customizable visibility on the context documents and the model's attentiveness towards such documents.

With a built-in user interface, retrieval index, and Large Language Model (LLM) backbone, RAGViz provides two main functionalities: (1) token and document-level attention visualization, and (2) generation comparison upon context document addition and removal. As an open-source toolkit, RAGViz can be easily hosted with a custom embedding model and HuggingFace-supported LLM backbone. Using a hybrid ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) index, memory-efficient LLM inference tool, and custom context snippet method, RAGViz operates efficiently with a median query time of about 5 seconds on a moderate GPU node.

To this end, we propose a novel framework, RuAG, to automatically distill large volumes of offline data into interpretable first-order logic rules, which are injected into LLMs to boost their reasoning capabilities. Our method begins by formulating the search process relying on LLMs' commonsense, where LLMs automatically define head and body predicates. Then, RuAG applies Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address the combinational searching space and efficiently discover logic rules from data. The resulting logic rules are translated into natural language, allowing targeted knowledge injection and seamless integration into LLM prompts for LLM's downstream task reasoning. We evaluate our framework on public and private industrial tasks, including natural language processing, time-series, decision-making, and industrial tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LLM's capability"

        "abstracts": "Despite significant advancements, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with providing accurate answers when lacking domain-specific or up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external knowledge bases, but it also introduces new attack surfaces. In this paper, we investigate data extraction attacks targeting the knowledge databases of RAG systems. We demonstrate that previous attacks on RAG largely depend on the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs, and that simple fine-tuning can reduce the success rate of such attacks to nearly zero. This makes these attacks impractical since fine-tuning is a common practice when deploying LLMs in specific domains. To further reveal the vulnerability, we propose to backdoor RAG, where a small portion of poisoned data is injected during the fine-tuning phase to create a backdoor within the LLM. When this compromised LLM is integrated into a RAG system, attackers can exploit specific triggers in prompts to manipulate the LLM to leak documents from the retrieval database. By carefully designing the poisoned data, we achieve both verbatim and paraphrased document extraction. We show that with only 3\\% poisoned data, our method achieves an average success rate of 79.7\\% in verbatim extraction on Llama2-7B, with a ROUGE-L score of 64.21, and a 68.6\\% average success rate in paraphrased extraction, with an average ROUGE score of 52.6 across four datasets. These results underscore the privacy risks associated with the supply chain when deploying RAG systems."

In using the dataset for RAG, we demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source embeddings and LLMs can yield superior accuracy compared to OpenAI's state-of-the-art proprietary embedding and LLM (GPT-4o).

        "abstracts": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generation capabilities but often struggle to access up-to-date information, which can lead to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by incorporating knowledge from external databases, enabling more accurate and relevant responses. Due to the context window constraints of LLMs, it is impractical to input the entire external database context directly into the model. Instead, only the most relevant information, referred to as chunks, is selectively retrieved. However, current RAG research faces three key challenges. First, existing solutions often select each chunk independently, overlooking potential correlations among them. Second, in practice the utility of chunks is non-monotonic, meaning that adding more chunks can decrease overall utility. Traditional methods emphasize maximizing the number of included chunks, which can inadvertently compromise performance. Third, each type of user query possesses unique characteristics that require tailored handling, an aspect that current approaches do not fully consider. To overcome these challenges, we propose a cost constrained retrieval optimization system CORAG for retrieval-augmented generation. We employ a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based policy framework to find optimal chunk combinations sequentially, allowing for a comprehensive consideration of correlations among chunks. Additionally, rather than viewing budget exhaustion as a termination condition, we integrate budget constraints into the optimization of chunk combinations, effectively addressing the non-monotonicity of chunk utility."

To address this, we propose a multi-source ARAG framework, termed MSPR, which synergizes reasoning and preference-driven retrieval to adaptive decide \"when and what to retrieve\" and \"which retrieval source to use\". To better adapt to retrieval sources of differing characteristics, we also employ retrieval action adjustment and answer feedback strategy.

In this study, we present RAG$^2$ (RAtionale-Guided RAG), a new framework for enhancing the reliability of RAG in biomedical contexts. RAG$^2$ incorporates three key innovations: a small filtering model trained on perplexity-based labels of rationales, which selectively augments informative snippets of documents while filtering out distractors; LLM-generated rationales as queries to improve the utility of retrieved snippets; a structure designed to retrieve snippets evenly from a comprehensive set of four biomedical corpora, effectively mitigating retriever bias.
